CORE CHARGE 5000 Label
This design perfectly captures the sustainable and technical aesthetic of the "Loop Logic: Core Charge 5000" power bank. It utilizes a clean, structured layout on a natural kraft cardboard box background, effectively balancing the bold technical specifications (5000mAh, 18W Fast Charge, USB-C PD) with clear sustainability icons (Recycled Content, Designed for Repair, 100% Recyclable Packaging). The use of black text and a muted forest green accent stripe reinforces the brand's commitment to transparency, durability, and eco-conscious design.
